<h1>Technical Charter (the “Charter”) for OpenColorIO a Series of LF Projects, LLC<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-charter-the-charter-for-opencolorio-a-series-of-lf-projects-llc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Adopted ___________</strong></p>
<p>This charter (the “Charter”) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the OpenColorIO project, which has been established as OpenColorIO a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”).  LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All Contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this Charter.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Mission and Scope of the Project</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>a.</strong> The mission of the Project is to develop an open source project with the goals indicated in the “README” file within the Project’s code repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>b.</strong> The scope of the Project includes software development under an OSI-approved open source license supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source software project.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Technical Steering Committee</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>a.</strong> The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>b.</strong> The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the “GOVERNANCE” file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the GOVERNANCE file.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>c.</strong> TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the GOVERNANCE file. Unless otherwise documented:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>i.</strong> Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ii.</strong> Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>iii.</strong> A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>d.</strong> Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>e.</strong> The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>f.</strong> The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the Technical Advisory Council of the Academy Software Foundation of The Linux Foundation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>g.</strong> Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>i.</strong> coordinating the technical direction of the Project;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ii.</strong> approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>iii.</strong> rganizing sub-projects and removing projects;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ii.</strong> creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>v.</strong> appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>vi.</strong> establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>vii.</strong> approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the Series Manager to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>viii.</strong> discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ix.</strong> coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project with the LF Projects Manager or their designee.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>TSC Voting</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>a.</strong> While the Project aims to operate as a consensus based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>b.</strong> Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least two-thirds of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>c.</strong> Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TSC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>d.</strong> In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Compliance with Policies</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>a.</strong> This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects. Contributors will comply with the policies of LF Projects as may be adopted and amended by LF Projects, including, without limitation the policies listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>b.</strong> The TSC may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Series Manager.  Contributors to the Project will comply with the CoC or, in the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies/.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>c.</strong> When amending or adopting any policy applicable to the Project, LF Projects will publish such policy, as to be amended or adopted, on its web site at least 30 days prior to such policy taking effect; provided, however, that in the case of any amendment of the Trademark Policy or Terms of Use of LF Projects, any such amendment is effective upon publication on LF Project’s web site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>d.</strong> All participants must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all participants by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Project community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all participants in the Project community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>e.</strong> The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times. The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions, and status should be made open and easily visible to all. Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the LF Projects Manager.</p></li>
